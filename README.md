# repulsive-sock-4762

             This is my construct week project. made with Java, JDBC, and MySQL technology.


In an educational Institute, there are several batches running every day for
same/different batches. It will be difficult for the Faculties and admin to know the status
of every batch. So the Automated Batch management System will of which batch is
assigned to which faculty.
